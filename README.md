# Text Sentiment Analysis
Utilizing Zipf’s Law, our team is looking to analyze the sentiment of text structure in a given sentence.  A Zipf distribution is a repeatable and naturally occurring layout of data that shows up in word prevalence.  Our goal is to analyze the structure of Yelp reviews and Datafiniti Hotel Reviews to determine the sentiments of users as they write reviews while incorporating Zipf’s law to improve efficiency by removing non-descriptive words. 
In order for our team to make an accurate analysis of the data being utilized, we can expect to use a minimum viable word count to make an accurate prediction. The team will create a mechanism for user input to get the appropriate sentiment analysis. 
The team will present this through a web app using Machine Learning, Flask, MongoDB, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.

## Hypothesis
Given a sufficiently large set of text, we can determine the positive or negative sentiment of the author.
## Null Hypothesis
Given a sufficiently large set of text, we are unable to determine the sentiment of the author.
## Goals/Intended Outcomes
1.  Prove the existence of Zipf’s law in random sets of text
2.  Use Machine Learning to build a model to predict the sentiment of a given set of text
3.  Determine the critical word count required to get an accurate sentiment.
## Data Sets Used
1.  Database of positive/negative reviews
2.  Database of movie/business reviews
3.  Flask App to access database, and JS/HTML representation
## Milestones
### Mung Data
### Setup Database
### Build Machine Learning Models
### Build Front-End Application
